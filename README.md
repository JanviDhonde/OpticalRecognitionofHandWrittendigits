## Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits 🔠

### 💡 Project Overview
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of two formats: **preprocessed data** and the **original data**, enabling flexible exploration and experimentation.

### 🔎 Objective
Develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits, leveraging the features provided in the dataset.

### 🌟 Key Insights and Features

#### Dataset Formats:
- **Preprocessed Data**: Found in `optdigits.tra` and `optdigits.tes`.
- **Original Format**: Found in files prefixed with `optdigits-orig`.

#### Features:
- Pixel intensity values representing the digit images.

#### Preprocessing:
- Details are provided in `optdigits.names`.

#### Classification Goal:
- Predict the digit (0-9) based on pixel intensity patterns.
